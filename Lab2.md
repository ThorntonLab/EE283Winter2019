# Lab 2: Python (and some comparison to R)

Some exercises to get you thinking about Python and pointing out some of what you can do with it.

## File processing in Python

1. How do you ask if a file exists?
2. How to you ask if a file is a directory?
3. How do you remove (delete) a file?
4. How do you get the size of a file? 
5. How do you get all the file names matching a pattern?
6. How do you get all the file names matching a pattern **recursively**?
7. How do you get an *iterator* to all files matching a pattern, as opposed to returning a potentially huge list?
8. How do you open gzip-compressed files for reading and for writing?

## In R

Same questions.  Except 7, which has no analog.


## Ok, let's do it!

Download [this](lab2data.tar.gz) and expand it.  It contains input (data) files and output (result) files.  But,
something went wrong and not all the output files were created.  Generate a list of those output files that were not
created.  Do it in R and in Python.  Which is easier/less annoying?
